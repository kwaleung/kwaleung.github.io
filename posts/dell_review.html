					<p>There we go, first real post on this website(Hooray!)</p>
					<p>Now that there's a week's worth of holiday, I figured out I should probabily update this website for a bit, not that I have the time to pickup the construction of the website though.</p>
					<p>Okay, that's enough for jibberish.</p>
					<p>So this time, just as the title suggests, I am going to talk about my new budget gaming laptop, Dell's Inspiron 15 (7567).</p>
					<p>Though the main focus of the article is how the device feels rather than how it sounds, here're some specs for your reference: </p>

					<p>For the price, it costs HKD 8000, definitely not cheap for a laptop, but certainly a deal for a laptop with gaming capabilities.</p>
					<h2 class="section-heading">The Review</h2>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/QlY7Ijy.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/QlY7Ijy.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
					<p>Just some background information, the 7567 is a huge upgrade compared to the Lenovo U41-70 which I owned previously, now serving as my family computer for light daily usage.</p>
					<p>In fact, there are a few things I'd like to mention about this laptop.</p>
					<br>
					<p>1. Battery life:</p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/S2xI75k.png">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/S2xI75k.png" alt="">
                    </a>
					<p>Man, the battery life on this brick is INSANE. For instance, I got a few chrome tabs, file explorer, filezilla and a few tabs of HTML code opened in notepad++ right now, 
					and it has been an hour since I unplugged from the charger. The estimated time left until the battery runs dry is 10 hrs 7 minutes at 87% battery level, which implies that the laptop can stay up to 11 hours
					for normal usage without breaking a sweat. Do keep in mind that the i5-7300HQ is a more energy demanding Quad Core chip, unlike most laptop Dual Core chips, which ends with the letter 'U'. 
					FYI, for the Lenovo U41-70 which runs on a i7-5500U with a smaller 14" screen compared with the 15.6" on the inspiron 15, as well as a weaker GPU (GT 740m), the battery life per charge can only last not more than 
					5 hours, not to mention lags occur from time to time.</p>
					<p>So to be simple, a monsterous battery which outclasses any standard notebooks, and according to online reviews, it even beats its competitors with similar hardware in terms of battery life.</p>
					<p>This point is actually very important, as I use the notebook mainly for productivity (e.g. coding, reading notes, surfing the net), the inspiron 15 can easily last through a standard day in university, say, 
					two lectures, one tutorial session and a lab session. So that I can keep my power brick in my bag or at home, unless I want to game at school :0)</p>
					<br>
					<p>2. Keyboard</p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/k5WoKNV.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/k5WoKNV.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
					<p>No matter coding or gaming, you need a responsive and comfortable keyboard to get stuff done, and the inspiron 15 does the trick. The red backlit keyboard works better than white ones in the dark, 
					as I personaly find red light more comfortable to look at, and I like red.(KEK)</p>
					<p>Also, the island-style keyboard with <b>FULL NUMBER PAD</b> has a nice feel and touch to it, and here I stress the importance of the number pad because I can't type Chinese without it and 
					an external one simply shat on me with horrible experience, not to mention the number pad allows me to switch weapons in PSO2 just like I always do while playing on my desktop :D.</p>
					<p>However, nothing's perfect and the only thing I find uncomfortable with is the set of direction keys, as they are too small and may be hard to locate.</p>
					<br>
					<p>3. Build Quality and Design</p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/3VDl3wd.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/3VDl3wd.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
					<p>The precedor of inspiron 15 7567, the inspiron 15 7559, was well-know for it's humble design for users who prefer a low-profile design for an entry level gaming laptop.</p>
					<p>But for the 7567, Dell has decided to throw a bit more expressive straight lines at the device, resulting in the parallelogram cross section when viewed from the side of the device. 
					Whether the design is acceptable or not is always about personal preferences, and my set of aesthe      tic standards gives a green light to this design. Combined with the 'exhaust pipe' heat sink layout on the rear and the 
					spider web speaker in the front, the inspiron 15 7567 sports an unique design I've never seen before, and actually suits me better.</p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/sVkqXSW.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/sVkqXSW.jpg" style="float: left" alt="">
                    </a>
					<span class="caption text-muted">Front side with the front facing speakers.</span>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/wKX0L0X.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/wKX0L0X.jpg" style="float: right" alt="">
                    </a>
					<span class="caption text-muted">Rear side with outlets highlighted in red.</span>
					<p>For the choice of material, the inspiron 15 7567 uses mainly plastic with a soft finish, and the black Dell logo sitting in the middle of the jet red lid has a glossy texture, which I find absolutely attractive. 
					In fact, many would consider plastic as cheap material for a laptop, but Dell did a great job making the inspiron feel sturdy in hand, especially for the middle hinge connecting the display and the base.</p>
					<p>Not to mention, the inspiron actually gives off a younger and energetic vibe when compared to the aluminium cases commonly used in laptops to give a premier feeling towards them. Just as young and inspiring as I am. (If I could stop messing up exams...)</p>
					<br>
					<p>4. Performance</p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/OmJHpd9.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/OmJHpd9.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
					<span class="caption text-muted">Though the older desktop still performs better, both machines managed to overkill the PSO2 benchmark on full load.</span>
					<p>Hands down people, we got a beast over here.</p>
					<p>To be honest, I am not a heavy gamer. If the game is really THAT heavy, even my desktop may not handle it well, so the base model with GTX 1050 absolutely overkilled my standards. </p>
					<p>At this price point, Dell packed in a GTX 1050, not a Ti model, but not a 'm' GPU you will find in previous generations of laptops. According to Nvidia, the new generation laptop GPUs offer around 10% performance less than its desktop variant, 
					and the results are not disappointing at all.</p>
					<p>On full loaded graphics, PSO2 runs 90 fps on average with no issues (110fps on desktop), and World of Warships runs on high settings above 60 fps without sharp spikes when switching to scope view. Pretty much the same as my desktop or even better due to the high RW rates of the SSD and more RAM available.</p>
					<p>I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to gaming performance of this laptop, and it's just the base model of the series.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
					<p>The inspiron 15 7567 is just the choice for me.</p>
					<blockquote>If a weapon is a warrior's best friend, a laptop is a coder's brother in arms</blockquote>
					<p>For the following, it may sound strange to you, but you may also resonate with me.</p>
					<p>Sometimes, I can feel whether I am affiliated to a certain object or not, and in this case, I can't feel anything from the Lenovo laptop, but holding the inspiron 15 7567 in my hand, I can feel like beating the hell out of everything.</p>
					<p>At least for now, I am certain that the inspiron 15 7567 is my personal Excalibur, though whether the wielder can push out the full potential of this combination is another story.</p>
